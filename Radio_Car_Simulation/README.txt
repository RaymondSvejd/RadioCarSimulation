# Car Simulator Project -by Raymond Svejd 

## Description
This Car Simulator allows users to simulate driving a car within a room. It provides feedback based on user commands, informing the user if the car hits a wall or successfully navigates through the space without collisions.

## Features
- Dynamic room sizes based on user input.
- Custom positioning of the car within the selected room.
- Interactive user inputs to control the car's direction and movement.
- Simple collision detection with error output indicating which wall was hit and where the collision occurred.

## Installation
Simply unzip and run the "Radio_Car_Simulation.exe" that you can find in \Radio_Car_Simulation\x64\Release.

## Discussion
I really enjoyed this project, it was fun to make, and I found myself trying out different ways to visualize the simulation many times. However, due to time constraints, I had to settle on a simple step-by-step output for clarification. Given more time, another approach to this project would be to create a nested loop with grid and tiles functionalities.
    
Have fun!
